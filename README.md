## üëã About

I am a security researcher and protocol engineer with a passion for building resilient systems and defending critical infrastructure.

‚Ä¢ Offensive Security, Penetration Testing  
‚Ä¢ Protocol & Firmware Reverse Engineering  
‚Ä¢ ICS/OT Security (SCADA, embedded, network protocols)  
‚Ä¢ Compliance: NIST CSF, ISO 27001, SOC 2, OWASP ASVS  
‚Ä¢ Automation & Performance: Go, C, Unix
